<p style="font-size:24px">Every year the Georgia Bulldawgs play teams in the SEC East which include South Carolina, Kentucky, Florida, Missouri, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt. This year UGA played the historic Fighting Irish of Notre Dame for the first time since 1981. That same year the head coach at the time Vince Dooley lead them to win the National Championship for UGA's second National Title.<br><br>This year is also looking up for the Dawgs as they currently are ranked number 1 in the nation over Alabama. The inspiration comes from the second year head coach Kirby Smart. Kirby Smart didn't have the best first season losing to teams that UGA traditionally does not lose to such as Tennessee, Vanderbilt, and Georgia Tech. At the end of the season he came out with a decent record of 8 wins 5 losses. However, UGA now leads the charge with a 9 - 0 win streak!</p>

<p style="width:700px; font-size:24px; float:left">With the addition of head coach Kirby smart the UGA Bulldawgs have boasted a record years in recruiting. Many fans were sad to see their star quarterback and number #1 recruit from last year Jacob Eason get hurt in the first game against Appalachian State. Thankfully, the recruiting process discovered another star quarter back number #11 Jake Fromm who has now lead the Dawgs to a 9 - 0 win streak, their longest since the early 2000's. In addition to quarterbacks, running backs have been a key focus for UGA recruiters. This year alone UGA has subbed in 7 different running backs to keep their players fresh and efficiency high. UGA ended with three 5 star recruits last year named Isaiah Wilson, Richard LeCounte, and D'Andre Swift. Continuing the tradition of great recruiting Kirby Smart has already locked in two 5 star recruits named Justin Fields and Zamir White their positions being quarterback and running back respectively. On the right you will find a list of notable players from the past as well as a drop down menu of all the current impact players.</p>
